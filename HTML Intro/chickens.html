      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red
      junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern
      Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male
      may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
      adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called
      a pullet.

      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
      Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas,
      Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
      subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western
      Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BCE.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young,
      bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now
      become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in
      American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically
      referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.

    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social behavior</h4>
    <h4>Broodiness</h4>
    <p>
      Chickens are omnivores.[25] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small
      snakes,[26] or young mice.
